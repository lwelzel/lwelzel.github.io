Hi, nice to meet you! I'm an astronomy and space engineering student looking for exoplanets.

I'm hoping we push the performance of next generation telescopes to finally get that juicy picture of a terrestrial exoplanet (we can do this, trust). Staring at pixelated blotches on my screen for extended amounts of time is still time well spent. Did you know they did surgery on a SNSPD? 

I will talk your ear off about deep learning, especially using it in exoplanet imaging and characterization. My favorite pastime is trying to convince astronomers to adopt more deep learning methods (impossible). Let me shoehorn reinforcement learning into more of exoplanet science, and we will become unstoppable. Hot take: PyTorch > NumPy also for computational physics (praise SGD). 

Two truths and a lie: I don't get too excited about tangents during my research, I've worked on high-powered cryogenic rocket engines, and the UN Security Council exempted me from the knowledge embargo on nuclear technology.

You can find more information about me, my projects and wonderful teams on this website.
