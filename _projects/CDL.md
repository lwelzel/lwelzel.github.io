One of the topics that fascinated me during my aerospace engineering BSc was how large space missions are planned and controlled on a technical level. 
Since the classes left much to be desired I joined the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/cdl">Collaborative Design Lab</a> (CDL) as a TA when it opened. 
Together with <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/b.t.c.zandbergen/">Barry Zandbergen</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.akay/">Iklim Akay</a> I gave students a practical introduction to concurrent and integrated system design activities in the CDL. 
Adoption of these practices have lead to modern engineering marvels; large projects completing ahead of schedule and under budget. 
As part of the CLD team I got unique insights into the processes driving collaborative design and the impact of different approaches to systems engineering.

While the CDL focuses on space engineering projects we managed to attract a diverse set of teams working wth us, from TU Delft courses (LR-MI-232, AE3200, AE4S10, AE4S52-21, AE4876-11), over student teams (DARE, Tumbleweed), to research staff (DEFAINE).

One of the unexpected aspects of working together with the CDL team is that I also got to have a look into education research.
