Together with <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.akay/">Iklim Akay</a> I developed and gave a systems engineering practicum for the Space Missions Minor which is a joint program by Leiden University, TU Delft and the Rotterdam Erasmus University.
For the practical session in the CDL I guided 5 student groups through a mock space mission design cycle. With this, the students got to practice the critical steps of their projects before starting the design of their own missions.
