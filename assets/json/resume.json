      "summary": "Exoplanet Atmosphere Characterization: assessing the impact of inhomogeneous datasets on comparative planetology.  In this internship I show that assuming space-based instrument comparability for exoplanet atmosphere retrievals biases the retrieval results. Further, my findings indicate the offset between space-based instruments can be as large as between ground- and space-based instruments, even between mature instruments on the HST. These findings have implications for our current understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and the science from instruments such as ARIEL and JWST.",
